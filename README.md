# Personal Developer Portfolio üöÄ

[![Site preview](/public/thumbnail.png)]

Welcome to my developer portfolio! This project showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a developer. Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). it not only provides a visually appealing representation of my work but also ensures optimal performance.

# Fonts ‚úçüèª

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# Project images üñºÔ∏è

All project images live under `public/images` and are automatically attached to each project based on the inclusion of the project's `slug` in their filenames

# GITHUB_TOKEN is required for some parts

# See https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token
